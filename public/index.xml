      <description>Abstract: I plot the variables:gender and age groups independently first.Then I try to relate them with the outcome ,and visulizie the relationship between them respectively.Despite the missing data and limitation of resources, I draw a conclusion that there exist a solid connection between age and the recovery rate.But there seem to be no difference beween the gender in front of the covid-19.
 Motivation: Covid-19 has made the world totally different,it destroys many people’s life,make a lot of people unemployed ，many companies to shut down, even deprive of many people’s life.</description>
