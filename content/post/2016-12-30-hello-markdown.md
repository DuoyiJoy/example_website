#About COVID-19 Cases in Toronto

Toronto Public Health is responding to an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, in the context of an evolving global pandemic. This data set contains demographic, geographic, and severity information for all confirmed and probable cases reported to and managed by Toronto Public Health since the first case was reported in January 2020. This includes cases that are sporadic (occurring in the community) and outbreak-associated. The data are extracted from the provincial communicable disease reporting system (iPHIS) and Toronto's custom COVID-19 case management system (CORES) and combined for reporting. Each line summarizes information for an individual case.
